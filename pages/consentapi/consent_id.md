### Element Usage ###

National Opt-Out uses the Consent.id element to store a universal unique identification (UUID) to each consent record that is created. Every new consent instance that is created using the National Opt-Out service will be allocated a UUID to identify that record and will retain that UUID throughout the lifespan of the instance. Depending on the opt-out preferences set by the patient, they may have 1 or 2 instances. Where no preferences have been set by the patient, a instance will not exist.

### id ###

|Name|Data Type|Description|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|id| string | A unique logical identifier (UUID) allocated by the National Opt-Out model.|

- 'id' **MUST** be used to uniquely identify a consent instance. This is the primary identifier for a patients consent preferences.
